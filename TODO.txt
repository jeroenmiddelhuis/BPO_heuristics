Heuristics to implemment:

2. Least Flexible Resource (LFR) First
* Rationale: Prioritize assigning the resource with the fewest compatible activities first.
* Usefulness: Maximizes long-term flexibility by reserving versatile resources for future unknown demands.
* Suitability: Ideal for maintaining operational flexibility under uncertainty.
* Cycle-Time Impact: Ensures that specialized resources are utilized efficiently, reducing likelihood of bottlenecks due to unavailable specialized resources later on.

3. Most Flexible Activity (MFA) First
* Rationale: Assign activities that can be handled by the largest subset of idle resources first.
* Usefulness: Quickly clears broadly compatible activities, preserving specialized resources.
* Suitability: Effective when there is frequent arrival of diverse activities.

2. Earliest Start Activity First (Immediate Activity Prioritization)
* Logic: Assign idle resources to activities of cases currently earliest in their journey (i.e., activities at early positions in the sequence).
* Cycle-Time Impact: Moves cases rapidly through their early stages, preventing early-stage bottlenecks that can increase overall cycle times.

Fewest Eligible Resources First (FERF)



Recommended Practical Strategy (Hybrid Approach):
Given the complexity and uncertainty of your online resource allocation problem, a combination of heuristics is typically more effective than single-rule dispatching:

Primary heuristic:

Shortest Estimated Remaining Cycle Time (SERCT) or Minimum Remaining Activities (MRA) (for aggressively pushing cases to completion quickly).

Secondary heuristic (tie-breaker):

Least Flexible Resource (LFR) or Fewest Eligible Resources First (FERF) (for preserving flexibility and addressing resource scarcity proactively).

This hybrid combination balances short-term speed with longer-term flexibility, minimizing cycle times in an unpredictable online environment.
